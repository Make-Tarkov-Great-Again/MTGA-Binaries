## Summary

The MTGA Core handles almost everything to create the Single Player experience of Escape from Tarkov.
Including but not limited to:
- Turning off BattlEye
- Turning off FileChecker (this is BSG's own checker, this needs to be turned off to allow us to mod the game) - See FileChecker
- Setting up Auto Singleplayer mode (see Menus)
- Fixing bots / AI to shoot each other (see AI)
- Fixing bots / AI to become "PMC" (see AI)
- Fixing "offline" mode to use only the designated online spawn points
- Fixing "offline" mode to save Progression of the character (something I used was in Live in some form!)
- Fixing "offline" mode to save Health of the character (something I used was in Live in some form!)
- Lots more

- Browse to where BepInEx is installed within your Tarkov folder
- Open config
